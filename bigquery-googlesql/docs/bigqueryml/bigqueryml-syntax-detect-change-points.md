This document describes the `ML.DETECT_CHANGE_POINTS` function, which performs
change point detection to identify intervals where the statistical behavior or
properties of time series data have shifted. This function provides insight
into significant structural breaks, rather than transient or isolated events,
without the overhead of creating and managing a model. For
example, you can use this function to detect a level change in daily product
sales after a marketing campaign.

While standard time series anomaly detection focuses on detecting sudden spikes
or outliers, `ML.DETECT_CHANGE_POINTS` is optimized to uncover anomalies that
appear gradually over time and sustained structural shifts.
All identified change points are represented
as time windows in which the change occurred, defined by a beginning and an
ending timestamp.

## Syntax

```googlesql
ML.DETECT_CHANGE_POINTS(
    { TABLE TABLE_NAME | (QUERY_STATEMENT) },
    data_col => 'DATA_COL',
    timestamp_col => 'TIMESTAMP_COL'
    [, id_cols => ID_COLS]
)
```

### Arguments

The `ML.DETECT_CHANGE_POINTS` function takes the following arguments:

- `TABLE_NAME`: the name of the table that contains the
  time series data to analyze.

- `QUERY_STATEMENT`: a GoogleSQL query
  that produces the time series data to analyze.

- `DATA_COL`: a `STRING` value that specifies the name of
  the column that contains the time series data. The data column must use one of
  the following data types: `INT64`, `NUMERIC`, `BIGNUMERIC`, or `FLOAT64`.

- `TIMESTAMP_COL`: a `STRING` value that specifies the
  name of the column that contains the timestamp data. The timestamp column must
  use one of the following data types: `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, or `DATETIME`.

- `ID_COLS`: an `ARRAY<STRING>` value that specifies the
  names of one or more ID columns. Each unique combination of IDs identifies a
  unique time series to analyze. Specify one or more values for this argument
  to analyze multiple time series using a single query. The columns
  that you specify must use one of the following data types: `STRING`, `INT64`,
  `ARRAY<STRING>`, or `ARRAY<INT64>`.

## Output

`ML.DETECT_CHANGE_POINTS` returns a table with the following columns:

- The columns specified in the `ID_COLS` argument.
- `begin_timestamp`: a `TIMESTAMP` value that corresponds to the start of the change point.
- `end_timestamp`: a `TIMESTAMP` value that corresponds to the end of the change point.
- `metrics`: a `STRUCT` value that contains metrics that describe the
  statistical behavior of the change point:

  - `avg`: a `FLOAT64` value that contains the average metric value within the change point.
  - `min`: a `FLOAT64` value that contains the minimum metric value within the change point.
  - `max`: a `FLOAT64` value that contains the maximum metric value within the change point.
  - `stddev`: a `FLOAT64` value that contains the standard deviation within the change point.
  - `count`: an `INT64` value that contains the total count of data points in the change point.
- `status`: a `STRING` value that contains error messages for invalid
  input. This column is empty for successful requests.

## Example

The following query shows how to detect change points in the number of
taxi rides taken per day:

    WITH
      daily_trips AS (
        SELECT
          EXTRACT(DATE FROM pickup_datetime) AS trip_date, COUNT(*) AS total_trips
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_20*`
        WHERE
          _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '19' AND '20'
          AND EXTRACT(DATE FROM pickup_datetime)
            BETWEEN '2019-01-01'
            AND '2020-12-31'
        GROUP BY trip_date
      )
    SELECT *
    FROM
      ML.DETECT_CHANGE_POINTS(
        TABLE daily_trips, data_col => 'total_trips', timestamp_col => 'trip_date');

The result is similar to the following:

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    | begin_timestamp         | end_timestamp           | metrics.avg | metrics.min | metrics.max | metrics.stddev | metrics.count | status |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    | 2019-12-19 00:00:00 UTC | 2020-01-04 00:00:00 UTC | 182990.2352 | 101917.0    | 286932.0    | 43974.28308757 | 17            |        |
    | 2020-03-06 00:00:00 UTC | 2020-03-22 00:00:00 UTC | 108567.2941 | 10341.0     | 243743.0    | 77690.85919106 | 17            |        |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

The following graph shows taxi ridership by date. The beginning and end of each
of the two change points is marked by a vertical line.

- The first change point reflects a small overall decrease in ridership. The shift begins December 19, 2019 and stabilizes January 1, 2020.
- The second change point reflects a much larger overall reduction in ridership. The shift begins March 6, 2020 and stabilizes March 22, 2020.
