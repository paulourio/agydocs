Graph Query Language (GQL) lets you execute multiple linear
graph queries in one query. Each linear graph query generates results
(the working table) and then passes those results to the next.

GQL supports the following building blocks, which can be composed into a
GQL query based on the [syntax rules](#gql_syntax).

## Language list

to composite the building blocks of GQL into a query.

#### Definitions

- `primitive_query_statement`: A statement in [Query statements](#language_list) except for the `NEXT` statement.
- `simple_linear_query_statement`: A list of `primitive_query_statement`s that ends with a [`RETURN` statement](#gql_return).
- `composite_linear_query_statement`: A list of `simple_linear_query_statement`s composited with the [set operators](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#set_operators).
- `linear_query_statement`: A statement that's either a `simple_linear_query_statement` or a `composite_linear_query_statement`.
- `multi_linear_query_statement`: A list of `linear_query_statement`s chained together with the [`NEXT` statement](#gql_next).
- `graph_query`: A GQL query that starts with a [`GRAPH` clause](#graph_query), then follows with a `multi_linear_query_statement`.

## `GRAPH` clause

```
GRAPH property_graph_name
multi_linear_query_statement
```

#### Description

Specifies a property graph to query. This clause must be added before the first
linear query statement in a graph query.

#### Definitions

- `property_graph_name`: The name of the property graph to query.
- `multi_linear_query_statement`: A multi linear query statement. For more information, see `multi_linear_query_statement` in [GQL syntax](#gql_syntax).

#### Examples

The following example queries the [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph) property graph to find
accounts with incoming transfers and looks up their owners:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (:Account)-[:Transfers]->(account:Account)
    RETURN account, COUNT(*) AS num_incoming_transfers
    GROUP BY account

    NEXT

    MATCH (account:Account)<-[:Owns]-(owner:Person)
    RETURN
      account.id AS account_id, owner.name AS owner_name,
      num_incoming_transfers

    /*---+
     | account_id | owner_name | num_incoming_transfers |
     +---+

## `CALL` statement

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Syntax characters enclosed in double quotes (`""`) are literal and required.

```
[ OPTIONAL ] CALL [ PER () ] tvf_name ( [ expression [ , ... ] ] ) [ YIELD tvf_column [ AS alias ] [ , ... ] ]
```

```
[ OPTIONAL ] CALL ( [ variable_name [ , ... ] ] ) "{" subquery "}"
```

#### Description

Executes a table valued function (TVF) or an
inline subquery over the working table.

#### Definitions

- `OPTIONAL`: A clause that retains all rows, including rows for which the TVF or subquery produces no output. Rows with no output return `NULL` values.
- `PER ()`: A clause that executes the TVF once on the entire working table instead of repeatedly on each row in the working table. You can't use the `OPTIONAL` clause with the `PER ()` clause.
- `tvf_name`: The name of the TVF to call.
- `expression`: An expression to pass as an argument to the TVF. The expression can also include variables from the current scope.
- `YIELD`: A clause that you use only with named TVFs to select and potentially rename output columns.
- `tvf_column`: The output column to return from the named TVF.
- `alias`: An optional alias to rename the yielded column in the working table.
- `variable_name`: A required, parenthesized list of variables from the outer scope that are available to the subquery. You can also use an empty variable list (`()`) for subqueries that don't reference any variables from the outer scope. You can redeclare or *multiply-declare* only node or edge variables from the outer scope to an inner scope path pattern of the subquery. With multiply-declared node or edge variables, both the outer and inner scope instances of the variable are equal. You can't multiply-declare other types of variables. For a demonstration of variable usage in subqueries, see the [inline subquery example](#call_example_subquery).
- `subquery`: A graph query enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) to execute. The subquery can reference only variables from the outer scope that the variable scope list includes. The subquery's `RETURN` statement defines the subquery output.

#### Details

The `CALL` statement supports modular query design and the invocation of complex
logic in a graph
query.

When calling a named TVF, you can use the optional `YIELD` clause to specify
which output columns from the TVF to add to the current working table.
If you omit the `YIELD` clause when calling a named TVF, all columns from the
TVF result are included.

When you use an inline subquery, you must use a variable scope list in
parentheses `()` before the opening curly brace `{` of the subquery. The
variable scope list specifies which variables from the outer query scope the
subquery can access. An empty variable scope list `()` indicates that
the subquery is self-contained and can't reference any variables from the outer
scope. Inline subqueries don't use the `YIELD` clause
because the subquery `RETURN` statement explicitly defines subquery output
columns.

The `OPTIONAL CALL` clause ensures that the input row still appears even if the
`CALL` statement produces no results for a given input row. In such cases, the
`CALL` statement adds `NULL` values to the columns where it produced no output.

**Behavior of `CALL PER ()` statement**

A bare `CALL` statement executes a TVF repeatedly for each row in the working
table. By contrast, a `CALL PER()` statement executes a TVF only once on the
entire working table, passing the working table as its first argument. This
first argument must be declared as a `TABLE` type in the TVF signature.

The `CALL PER()` statement allows the TVF to perform operations on the whole set
of intermediate results. The TVF can access all
columns of the input working table.

The `CALL PER()` statement can be used with only named TVFs and doesn't support
inline subqueries. The `CALL PER()` statement doesn't support the `OPTIONAL`
clause.

The working table resulting from a `CALL PER()` statement contains only the
columns specified in the `YIELD` clause, or all columns from the TVF output if
you omit `YIELD`. The `CALL PER()` statement doesn't carry over columns from the
input working table. The number of rows in the working table might also change
depending on the TVF's output cardinality.

**Column-naming rules**

Queries that use the `CALL` statement must maintain the following
column-naming rules for uniqueness:

- **Within the TVF or subquery output:** The columns returned by the TVF or inline subquery itself must have unique names. For a subquery, the `RETURN` statement enforces name uniqueness. For a TVF, the TVF definition inherently ensures name uniqueness.
- **Combined output:** The final set of columns generated by the query includes columns from the input table and columns added by the `CALL` statement. All final columns must have unique names. When you call a named TVF, you can use the `YIELD` clause with `AS` to rename output columns and prevent naming conflicts. For subqueries, ensure that the column names in the `RETURN` statement don't conflict with existing columns in the outer scope.

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

**Example: Call a named TVF with `YIELD`**

The following example creates and calls a table-valued function (TVF) and uses
the `YIELD` clause to rename a column:

    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION graph_db.return_input_tvf(arg STRING) AS (
      SELECT arg AS col
    );

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    CALL graph_db.return_input_tvf(p.name) YIELD col AS name
    RETURN name
    ORDER BY name;

    /*---+
     | name    |
     +---+
     | Alex    |
     | Dana    |
     | Lee     |
     +---*/


**Example: Call an inline subquery**

The following example calls an inline subquery to find accounts owned by each
matched person `p`:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    CALL (p) {
      MATCH (p)-[:Owns]->(a:Account)
      RETURN a.Id AS account_Id
    }
    RETURN p.name AS person_name, account_Id
    ORDER BY person_name, account_Id;

    /*---+
     | person_name | account_Id |
     +---+
     | Alex        | 7          |
     | Dana        | 20         |
     | Lee         | 16         |
     +---*/

Notice that the example declares the outer-scoped node variable `p` (`CALL (p)`)
from the `MATCH (p:Person)` clause. This declaration enables the node variable
to be redeclared or *multiply-declared* in a path pattern of the subquery. If
the `CALL` statement doesn't declare the node variable `p`, then the redeclared
variable `p` in the subquery is treated as a new variable, independent of the
outer-scoped variable (not multiply-declared), and returns different results.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)  -- Outer-scoped variable `p`
    CALL () {  -- `p` not declared
      MATCH (p)-[:Owns]->(a:Account)  -- Inner-scoped variable `p`, independent of outer-scoped `p`
      RETURN a.Id AS account_Id
    }
    RETURN p.name AS person_name, account_Id
    ORDER BY person_name, account_Id;

    -- Altered query results
    /*---+
     | person_name | account_Id |
     +---+
     | Alex        | 7          |
     | Alex        | 16         |
     | Alex        | 20         |
     | Dana        | 7          |
     | Dana        | 16         |
     | Dana        | 20         |
     | Lee         | 7          |
     | Lee         | 16         |
     | Lee         | 20         |
     +---*/

Additionally, the following version of the query fails because the declared
variable `Id` isn't a node or an edge variable. You can redeclare only node or
edge variables in subqueries.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person {Id:2})
    LET Id = p.Id
    CALL (Id) {  -- Non-node, non-edge variable `Id` declared
      MATCH (p)-[:Owns]->(a:Account)
      RETURN a.Id  -- Not allowed, outer-scoped `Id` isn't a node or edge variable, so you can't redeclare it.
    }
    RETURN p.name AS person_name, Id;

    /*
    ERROR: generic::invalid_argument: Variable name: Id already exists [at 6:3]
      RETURN a.Id
    */

**Example: Call an inline subquery with aggregation**

The following query calls an inline subquery that aggregates the number of
accounts `a` for each matched person `p`:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    CALL (p) {
      MATCH (p)-[:Owns]->(a:Account)
      RETURN count(a) AS num_accounts
    }
    RETURN p.name, num_accounts
    ORDER BY num_accounts DESC, p.name;

    /*---+
     | name   | num_accounts |
     +---+
     | Dana   | 1            |
     | Alex   | 1            |
     | Lee    | 1            |
     +---*/

**Example: Use `OPTIONAL` to include `NULL` row values**

The following query finds account transfers `t` for each person `p`. The
`OPTIONAL` clause includes rows for which the TVF or subquery produces no
output. Rows with no output return `NULL` values. Without the `OPTIONAL` clause,
rows with no output are excluded from the results.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    OPTIONAL CALL (p) {
      MATCH (p)-[:Owns]->(a:Account)-[t:Transfers]->()
      RETURN a.Id AS account_id, t.amount AS transfer_amount, DATE(t.create_time) AS transfer_date
    }
    RETURN p.name, account_id, transfer_amount, transfer_date
    ORDER BY p.name, transfer_date DESC;

    /*---+
     | name   | account_id | transfer_amount | transfer_date |
     +---+
     | Alex   | 7          | 100             | 2020-10-04    |
     | Alex   | 7          | 300             | 2020-08-29    |
     | Dana   | 20         | 200             | 2020-10-17    |
     | Dana   | 20         | 500             | 2020-10-04    |
     | Lee    | 16         | 300             | 2020-09-25    |
     +---*/

**Example: Use `RETURN` to rename conflicting subquery column names**

The following query uses the `RETURN` alias in the subquery to avoid conflicting
with the `p.Id` column.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person {Id: 1})
    CALL (p) {
      MATCH (p)-[:Owns]->(a:Account)
      RETURN a.Id AS account_Id
    }
    RETURN p.Id AS person_Id, account_Id;

    /*---+
     | person_Id | account_Id |
     +---+
     | 1         | 7          |
     +---*/

**Example: Filter subquery results**

The following query finds transfers over 50 dollar amounts for each person:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    CALL (p) {
      MATCH (p)-[:Owns]->(a:Account)-[t:Transfers]->()
      WHERE t.amount > 50
      RETURN a.Id AS account_id, t.amount
    }
    RETURN p.name, account_id, amount
    ORDER BY p.name, amount DESC;

    /*---+
     | name   | account_id | amount |
     +---+
     | Alex   | 7          | 300    |
     | Alex   | 7          | 100    |
     | Dana   | 20         | 500    |
     | Dana   | 20         | 200    |
     | Lee    | 16         | 300    |
     +---*/

**Example: Use an empty scope list in a subquery**

The following subquery counts all `Person` nodes. The `total_persons` value is
the same for all output rows because the subquery in the `CALL ()` statement is
empty and doesn't depend on any variables from the outer scope.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    CALL () {
      MATCH (n:Person)
      RETURN count(n) AS total_persons
    }
    RETURN p.name, total_persons
    ORDER BY p.name;

    /*---+
     | name   | total_persons |
     +---+
     | Alex   | 3             |
     | Dana   | 3             |
     | Lee    | 3             |
     +---*/

**Example: Call a named TVF on the entire working table with `PER ()`**

The following query uses the `CALL PER()` statement to call a table-valued
function (TVF) on the entire working table. The `CALL PER()` statement passes the
working table from the previous query to the TVF:

    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION graph_db.return_input_table_tvf(t TABLE<name STRING>) AS (
      SELECT * FROM t
    );

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name AS name

    NEXT

    CALL PER() graph_db.return_input_table_tvf() YIELD name
    RETURN name
    ORDER BY name;

    /*---+
     | name   |
     +---+
     | Alex   |
     | Dana   |
     | Lee    |
     +---*/

## `FILTER` statement

```
FILTER [ WHERE ] bool_expression
```

#### Description

Filters out rows in the query results that don't satisfy a specified condition.

#### Definitions

- `bool_expression`: A boolean expression. Only rows whose `bool_expression` evaluates to `TRUE` are included. Rows whose `bool_expression` evaluates to `NULL` or `FALSE` are discarded.

#### Details

The `FILTER` statement can reference columns in the working table.

The syntax for the `FILTER` statement is similar to the syntax for the
[graph pattern `WHERE` clause](graph-patterns.md#graph_pattern_definition), but they are evaluated
differently. The `FILTER` statement is evaluated after the previous statement.
The `WHERE` clause is evaluated as part of the containing statement.

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

In the following query, people with `Id = 1` are excluded from the
results table:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)-[o:Owns]->(a:Account)
    FILTER p.Id <> 1
    RETURN p.name, a.Id AS account_id

    /*---+---+
     | name   | account_id |
     +---+---+
     | "Dana" | 20         |
     | "Lee"  | 16         |
     +---+---*/

`WHERE` is an optional keyword that you can include in a `FILTER` statement.
The following query is semantically identical to the previous query:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)-[o:Owns]->(a:Account)
    FILTER WHERE p.Id <> 1
    RETURN p.name, a.Id AS account_id

    /*---+---+
     | name   | account_id |
     +---+---+
     | "Dana" |         20 |
     | "Lee"  |         16 |
     +---+---*/

In the following example, `FILTER` follows an aggregation step with
grouping. Semantically, it's similar to the `HAVING` clause in SQL:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(dest:Account)
    RETURN source, COUNT(e) AS num_transfers
    GROUP BY source

    NEXT

    FILTER WHERE num_transfers > 1
    RETURN source.id AS source_id, num_transfers

    /*---+
     | source_id | num_transfers |
     +---+
     | 7         | 2             |
     | 20        | 2             |
     +---*/

In the following example, an error is produced because `FILTER` references
`m`, which isn't in the working table:

    -- Error: m doesn't exist
    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)-[o:Owns]->(a:Account)
    FILTER WHERE m.Id <> 1
    RETURN p.name

In the following example, an error is produced because even though `p` is in the
working table, `p` doesn't have a property called `date_of_birth`:

    -- ERROR: date_of_birth isn't a property of p
    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)-[o:Owns]->(a:Account)
    FILTER WHERE p.date_of_birth < '1990-01-10'
    RETURN p.name

## `FOR` statement

```
FOR element_name IN array_expression
  [ with_offset_clause ]

with_offset_clause:
  WITH OFFSET [ AS offset_name ]
```

#### Description

Unnests an `ARRAY`-typed expression and joins the result with the current working table.

#### Definitions

- `array_expression`: An `ARRAY`-typed expression.
- `element_name`: The name of the element column. The name can't be the name of a column that already exists in the current linear query statement.
- `offset_name`: The name of the offset column. The name can't be the name of a column that already exists in the current linear query statement. If not specified, the default is `offset`.

#### Details

The `FOR` statement expands the working table by defining a new column for the
elements of `array_expression`, with an optional offset column. The cardinality
of the working table might change as a result.

- The `FOR` statement can reference columns in the working table.
- The `FOR` statement evaluation is similar to the [`UNNEST`](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#unnest_operator) operator.
- The `FOR` statement doesn't preserve order.
- An empty or `NULL` `array_expression` produces zero rows.

The keyword `WITH` following the `FOR` statement is always interpreted as the
beginning of `with_offset_clause`. If you want to use the `WITH` statement
following the `FOR` statement, you should fully qualify the `FOR` statement with
`with_offset_clause`, or use the `RETURN` statement instead of the `WITH`
statement.

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

In the following query, there are three rows in the working table prior to the
`FOR` statement. After the `FOR` statement, each row is expanded into two rows,
one per `element` value from the array.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)-[o:Owns]->(a:Account)
    FOR element in ["all","some"] WITH OFFSET
    RETURN p.Id, element as alert_type, offset
    ORDER BY p.Id, element, offset

    /*---+
     | Id   | alert_type | offset |
     +---+
     | 1    | all        | 0      |
     | 1    | some       | 1      |
     | 2    | all        | 0      |
     | 2    | some       | 1      |
     | 3    | all        | 0      |
     | 3    | some       | 1      |
     +---*/

In the following query, there are two rows in the working table prior to the
`FOR` statement. After the `FOR` statement, each row is expanded into a
different number of rows, based on the value of `array_expression` for that row.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)-[o:Owns]->(a:Account)
    FILTER WHERE p.Id <> 1
    FOR element in GENERATE_ARRAY(1, p.Id)
    RETURN p.Id, element
    ORDER BY p.Id, element

    /*---+
     | Id   | element |
     +---+
     | 2    | 1       |
     | 2    | 2       |
     | 3    | 1       |
     | 3    | 2       |
     | 3    | 3       |
     +---*/

In the following query, there are three rows in the working table prior to the
`FOR` statement. After the `FOR` statement, no row is produced because
`array_expression` is an empty array.

    -- No rows produced
    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    FOR element in [] WITH OFFSET AS off
    RETURN p.name, element, off

In the following query, there are three rows in the working table prior to the
`FOR` statement. After the `FOR` statement, no row is produced because
`array_expression` is a `NULL` array.

    -- No rows produced
    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    FOR element in CAST(NULL AS ARRAY<STRING>) WITH OFFSET
    RETURN p.name, element, offset

In the following example, an error is produced because `WITH` is used directly
After the `FOR` statement. The query can be fixed by adding `WITH OFFSET` after
the `FOR` statement, or by using `RETURN` directly instead of `WITH`.

    -- Error: Expected keyword OFFSET but got identifier "element"
    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    FOR element in [1,2,3]
    WITH element as col
    RETURN col
    ORDER BY col

## `LET` statement

```
LET linear_graph_variable[, ...]

linear_graph_variable:
  variable_name = value
```

#### Description

Defines variables and assigns values to them for later use in the current
linear query statement.

#### Definitions

- `linear_graph_variable`: The variable to define.
- `variable_name`: The name of the variable.
- `value`: A scalar expression that represents the value of the variable. The names referenced by this expression must be in the incoming working table.

#### Details

`LET` doesn't change the cardinality of the working table nor modify its
existing columns.

- The variable can only be used in the current linear query statement. To use it in a following linear query statement, you must include it in the `RETURN` statement as a column.
- You can't define and reference a variable within the same `LET` statement.
- You can't redefine a variable with the same name.
- You can use horizontal aggregate functions in this statement. To learn more, see [Horizontal aggregate function calls in GQL](graph-gql-functions.md#gql-horiz-agg-func-calls).

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

In the following graph query, the variable `a` is defined and then referenced
later:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    LET a = source
    RETURN a.id AS a_id

    /*---+
     | a_id |
     +---+
     | 20   |
     | 7    |
     | 7    |
     | 20   |
     | 16   |
     +---*/

The following `LET` statement in the second linear query statement is valid
because `a` is defined and returned from the first linear query statement:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    LET a = source
    RETURN a

    NEXT

    LET b = a -- Valid: 'a' is defined and returned from the linear query statement above.
    RETURN b.id AS b_id

    /*---+
     | b_id |
     +---+
     | 20   |
     | 7    |
     | 7    |
     | 20   |
     | 16   |
     +---*/

The following `LET` statement in the second linear query statement is invalid
because `a` isn't returned from the first linear query statement.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    LET a = source
    RETURN source.id

    NEXT

    LET b = a  -- ERROR: 'a' doesn't exist.
    RETURN b.id AS b_id

The following `LET` statement is invalid because `a` is defined and then
referenced in the same `LET` statement:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    LET a = source, b = a -- ERROR: Can't define and reference 'a' in the same operation.
    RETURN a

The following `LET` statement is valid because `a` is defined first and then
referenced afterwards:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    LET a = source
    LET b = a
    RETURN b.id AS b_id

    /*---+
     | b_id |
     +---+
     | 20   |
     | 7    |
     | 7    |
     | 20   |
     | 16   |
     +---*/

In the following examples, the `LET` statements are invalid because `a` is
redefined:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    LET a = source, a = destination -- ERROR: 'a' has already been defined.
    RETURN a.id AS a_id

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    LET a = source
    LET a = destination -- ERROR: 'a' has already been defined.
    RETURN a.id AS a_id

In the following examples, the `LET` statements are invalid because `b` is
redefined:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    LET a = source
    LET b = destination
    RETURN a, b

    NEXT

    MATCH (a)
    LET b = a -- ERROR: 'b' has already been defined.
    RETURN b.id

The following `LET` statement is valid because although `b` is defined in the
first linear query statement, it's not passed to the second linear query
statement:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    LET a = source
    LET b = destination
    RETURN a

    NEXT

    MATCH (a)
    LET b = a
    RETURN b.id

    /*---+
     | b_id |
     +---+
     | 20   |
     | 7    |
     | 7    |
     | 20   |
     | 16   |
     +---*/

## `LIMIT` statement

```
LIMIT count
```

#### Description

Limits the number of query results.

#### Definitions

- `count`: A non-negative `INT64` value that represents the number of results to produce. For more information, see the [`LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#limit_and_offset_clause).

#### Details

The `LIMIT` statement can appear before the `RETURN` statement. You can also use
it as a qualifying clause in the [`RETURN` statement](#gql_return).

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

The following example uses the `LIMIT` statement to limit the query results to
three rows:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (source:Account)-[e:Transfers]->(destination:Account)
    ORDER BY source.Id
    LIMIT 3
    RETURN source.Id, source.nick_name

    /*---+---+
     | Id      | nick_name     |
     +---+---+
     | 7       | Vacation fund |
     | 7       | Vacation fund |
     | 16      | Vacation fund |
     +---*/

The following query finds the account and its owner with the most outgoing
transfers to a blocked account:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src_account:Account)-[transfer:Transfers]->(dst_account:Account {is_blocked:true})
    RETURN src_account, COUNT(transfer) as total_transfers
    ORDER BY total_transfers
    LIMIT 1
    NEXT
    MATCH (src_account:Account)<-[owns:Owns]-(owner:Person)
    RETURN src_account.id AS account_id, owner.name AS owner_name

    /*---+
     | account_id | owner_name |
     +---+
     | 20         | Dana       |
     +---*/

## `MATCH` statement

```
[ OPTIONAL ] MATCH graph_pattern
```

#### Description

Matches data described by a graph pattern. You can have zero or more `MATCH`
statements in a linear query statement.

#### Definitions

- `MATCH graph_pattern`: The graph pattern to match. For more information, see [`MATCH` graph pattern definition](graph-patterns.md#graph_pattern_definition).
- `OPTIONAL MATCH graph_pattern`: The graph pattern to optionally match. If there are missing parts in the pattern, the missing parts are represented by `NULL` values. For more information, see [`OPTIONAL MATCH` graph pattern definition](graph-patterns.md#graph_pattern_definition).

#### Details

The `MATCH` statement joins the incoming working table with the matched
result with either `INNER JOIN` or `CROSS JOIN` semantics.

The `INNER JOIN` semantics is used when the working table and matched result
have variables in common. In the following example, the `INNER JOIN`
semantics is used because `account` is produced by both `MATCH` statements:

    MATCH (person:Person)-[:Owns]->(account:Account)
    MATCH (account)-[:Transfers]->(otherAcct:Account)

The `CROSS JOIN` semantics is used when the incoming working table and matched
result have no variables in common. In the following example, the `CROSS JOIN`
semantics is used because `person1` and `account` exist in the result of the
first `MATCH` statement, but not the second one:

    MATCH (person1:Person)-[:Owns]->(account:Account)
    MATCH (person2:Person)-[:Owns]->(otherAcct:Account)

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

## `NEXT` statement

```
NEXT
```

#### Description

Chains multiple linear query statements together.

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

The following linear query statements are chained by the `NEXT` statement:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (:Account)-[:Transfers]->(account:Account)
    RETURN account, COUNT(*) AS num_incoming_transfers
    GROUP BY account

    NEXT

    MATCH (account:Account)<-[:Owns]-(owner:Person)
    RETURN
      account.id AS account_id, owner.name AS owner_name,
      num_incoming_transfers

     +---*/

## `OFFSET` statement

```
OFFSET count
```

#### Description

Skips a specified number of rows in the query results.

#### Definitions

- `count`: A non-negative `INT64` value that represents the number of rows to skip. For more information, see the [`LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#limit_and_offset_clause).

#### Details

The `OFFSET` statement can appear anywhere in a linear query statement before
the `RETURN` statement.

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

In the following example, the first two rows aren't included in the results:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    OFFSET 2
    RETURN p.name, p.id

    /*---+
     | name | id |
     +---+
     | Lee  | 3  |
     +---*/

## `ORDER BY` statement

```
ORDER BY order_by_specification[, ...]

order_by_specification:
  expression
  [ { ASC | ASCENDING | DESC | DESCENDING } ]
  [ { NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST } ]
```

#### Description

Orders the query results.

#### Definitions

- `expression`: The sort criterion for the result set. For more information, see the [`ORDER BY` clause](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#order_by_clause).
- `COLLATE collation_specification`: The collation specification for `expression`. For more information, see the [`ORDER BY` clause](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#order_by_clause).
- `ASC | ASCENDING | DESC | DESCENDING`: The sort order, which can be either
  ascending or descending. The following options are synonymous:

  - `ASC` and `ASCENDING`

  - `DESC` and `DESCENDING`

  For more information about sort order, see the
  [`ORDER BY` clause](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#order_by_clause).
- `NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST`: Determines how `NULL` values are sorted for
  `expression`. For more information, see the
  [`ORDER BY` clause](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#order_by_clause).

#### Details

Ordinals aren't supported in the `ORDER BY` statement.

The `ORDER BY` statement is ignored unless it's immediately followed by the
`LIMIT` or `OFFSET` statement.

If you would like to apply `ORDER BY` to what is in `RETURN` statement, use the
`ORDER BY` clause in `RETURN` statement. For more information, see
[`RETURN` statement](#gql_return).

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

The following query sorts the results by the `transfer.amount`
values in descending order:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src_account:Account)-[transfer:Transfers]->(dst_account:Account)
    ORDER BY transfer.amount DESC
    LIMIT 3
    RETURN src_account.id AS account_id, transfer.amount AS transfer_amount

    /*---+
     | account_id | transfer_amount |
     +---+
     | 20         | 500             |
     | 7          | 300             |
     | 16         | 300             |
     +---*/

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src_account:Account)-[transfer:Transfers]->(dst_account:Account)
    ORDER BY transfer.amount DESC
    OFFSET 1
    RETURN src_account.id AS account_id, transfer.amount AS transfer_amount

    /*---+
     | account_id | transfer_amount |
     +---+
     | 7          | 300             |
     | 16         | 300             |
     | 20         | 200             |
     | 7          | 100             |
     +---*/

If you don't include the `LIMIT` or `OFFSET` statement right after the
`ORDER BY` statement, the effect of `ORDER BY` is discarded and the result is
unordered.

    -- Warning: The transfer.amount values aren't sorted because the
    -- LIMIT statement is missing.
    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src_account:Account)-[transfer:Transfers]->(dst_account:Account)

     +---*/

    -- Warning: Using the LIMIT clause in the RETURN statement, but not immediately

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src_account:Account)-[transfer:Transfers]->(dst_account:Account)
    ORDER BY transfer.amount DESC

## `RETURN` statement

```
RETURN *
```

```
RETURN
  [ { ALL | DISTINCT } ]
  return_item[, ... ]
  [ group_by_clause ]
  [ order_by_clause ]
  [ limit_and_offset_clauses ]

return_item:
expression [ AS alias ]

limit_and_offset_clauses:
  {
    limit_clause
    | offset_clause
    | offset_clause limit_clause
  }
```

#### Description

Marks the end of a linear query statement and returns the results. Only one `RETURN`
statement is allowed in a linear query statement.

#### Definitions

- `*`: Returns all columns in the current working table.
- `return_item`: A column to include in the results.
- `ALL`: Returns all rows. This is equivalent to not using any prefix.
- `DISTINCT`: Duplicate rows are discarded and only the remaining distinct rows are returned. This deduplication takes place after any aggregation is performed.
- `expression`: An expression that represents a column to produce. Aggregation is supported.
- `alias`: An alias for `expression`.
- `group_by_clause`: Groups the current rows of the working table, using the [`GROUP BY` clause](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#group_by_clause). If `GROUP BY ALL` is applied, the groupable items from the `return_item` list are used to group the rows.
- `order_by_clause`: Orders the current rows in a linear query statement, using the [`ORDER BY` clause](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#order_by_clause).
- `limit_clause`: Limits the number of current rows in a linear query statement, using the [`LIMIT` clause](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#limit_and_offset_clause).
- `offset_clause`: Skips a specified number of rows in a linear query statement, using the [`OFFSET` clause](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#limit_and_offset_clause).

#### Details

You can return graph elements to make them visible from one linear query
statement to the next, but the final `RETURN` statement in a graph query can't
contain a graph element on its own. Instead, you can return a property of a
graph element.

Ordinals aren't supported in the `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` clauses.

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

The following query returns `p.name` and `p.id`:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, p.id

    /*---+
     | name | id |
     +---+
     | Alex | 1  |
     | Dana | 2  |
     | Lee  | 3  |
     +---*/

The following query fails because you can't return a graph element from a
query:

    -- Error: You can't return a graph element
    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p

In the following example, the first linear query statement returns all columns
including `p`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The second linear query statement returns the
specified `p.name` and `d` columns:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    LET a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
    RETURN *

    NEXT

    RETURN p.name, (a + b + c) AS d

    /*---+
     | name | d |
     +---+
     | Alex | 6 |
     | Dana | 6 |
     | Lee  | 6 |
     +---*/

The following query returns distinct rows:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src:Account {id: 7})-[e:Transfers]->{1, 3}(dst:Account)
    RETURN DISTINCT ARRAY_LENGTH(e) AS hops, dst.id AS destination_account_id

    /*---+
     | hops | destination_account_id |
     +---+
     | 3    | 7                      |
     | 1    | 16                     |
     | 3    | 16                     |
     | 2    | 20                     |
     +---*/

In the following example, the first linear query statement returns `account` and
aggregated `num_incoming_transfers` per account. The second statement returns
sorted result.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (:Account)-[:Transfers]->(account:Account)
    RETURN account, COUNT(*) AS num_incoming_transfers
    GROUP BY account

    NEXT

    MATCH (account:Account)<-[:Owns]-(owner:Person)
    RETURN owner.name AS owner_name, num_incoming_transfers
    ORDER BY num_incoming_transfers DESC

    /*---+
     | owner_name | num_incoming_transfers |
     +---+
     | Lee        | 3                      |
     | Alex       | 1                      |
     | Dana       | 1                      |
     +---*/

In the following example, the `GROUP BY ALL` clause groups rows by inferring
grouping keys from the return items in the `RETURN` statement.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (:Account)-[:Transfers]->(account:Account)
    RETURN account, COUNT(*) AS num_incoming_transfers
    GROUP BY ALL
    ORDER BY num_incoming_transfers DESC

    NEXT

    MATCH (account:Account)<-[:Owns]-(owner:Person)
    RETURN owner.name AS owner_name, num_incoming_transfers

    /*---+
     | owner_name | num_incoming_transfers |
     +---+
     | Alex       | 1                      |
     | Dana       | 1                      |
     | Lee        | 3                      |
     +---*/

In the following example, the `LIMIT` clause in the `RETURN` statement
reduces the results to one row:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, p.id
    LIMIT 1

    /*---+
     | name | id |
     +---+
     | Alex | 1  |
     +---*/

In the following example, the `OFFSET` clause in the `RETURN` statement
skips the first row:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, p.id
    OFFSET 1

    /*---+
     | name | id |
     +---+
     | Dana | 2  |
     | Lee  | 3  |
     +---*/

In the following example, the `OFFSET` clause in the `RETURN` statement
skips the first row, then the `LIMIT` clause reduces the
results to one row:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, p.id
    OFFSET 1
    LIMIT 1

    /*---+
     | name | id |
     +---+
     | Dana | 2  |
     +---*/

In the following example, an error is produced because the `OFFSET` clause must
come before the `LIMIT` clause when they are both used in the
`RETURN` statement:

    -- Error: The LIMIT clause must come after the OFFSET clause in a
    -- RETURN operation.
    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, p.id
    LIMIT 1
    OFFSET 1

In the following example, the `ORDER BY` clause in the `RETURN` statement sorts
the results by `hops` and then `destination_account_id`:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src:Account {id: 7})-[e:Transfers]->{1, 3}(dst:Account)
    RETURN DISTINCT ARRAY_LENGTH(e) AS hops, dst.id AS destination_account_id
    ORDER BY hops, destination_account_id

    /*---+
     | hops | destination_account_id |
     +---+
     | 1    | 16                     |
     | 2    | 20                     |
     | 3    | 7                      |
     | 3    | 16                     |
     +---*/

## `SKIP` statement

```
SKIP count
```

#### Description

Synonym for the [`OFFSET` statement](#gql_offset).

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

`SKIP` is a synonym for `OFFSET`. Therefore, these queries are equivalent:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    SKIP 2
    RETURN p.name, p.id

    /*---+
     | name | id |
     +---+
     | Lee  | 3  |
     +---*/

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    OFFSET 2
    RETURN p.name, p.id

    /*---+
     | name | id |
     +---+
     | Lee  | 3  |
     +---*/

## `WITH` statement

```
WITH
  [ { ALL | DISTINCT } ]
  return_item[, ... ]
  [ group_by_clause ]

return_item:
expression [ AS alias ]

```

#### Description

Passes on the specified columns, optionally filtering, renaming, and
transforming those results.

#### Definitions

- `*`: Returns all columns in the current working table.
- `ALL`: Returns all rows. This is equivalent to not using any prefix.
- `DISTINCT`: Returns distinct rows. Deduplication takes place after aggregations are performed.
- `return_item`: A column to include in the results.
- `expression`: An expression that represents a column to produce. Aggregation is supported.
- `alias`: An alias for `expression`.
- `group_by_clause`: Groups the current rows of the working table, using the [`GROUP BY` clause](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#group_by_clause). If `GROUP BY ALL` is applied, the groupable items from the `return_item` list are used to group the rows.

#### Details

If any expression performs aggregation, and no `GROUP BY` clause is
specified, all groupable items from the return list are implicitly used as
grouping keys (This is equivalent to `GROUP BY ALL`).

Window functions aren't supported in `expression`.

Ordinals aren't supported in the `GROUP BY` clause.

#### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The examples in this section reference a property graph called [`FinGraph`](graph-schema-statements.md#fin_graph).

The following query returns all distinct destination account IDs:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src:Account)-[transfer:Transfers]->(dst:Account)
    WITH DISTINCT dst
    RETURN dst.id AS destination_id

    /*---+
     | destination_id |
     +---+
     | 7              |
     | 16             |
     | 20             |
     +---*/

The following query uses `*` to carry over the existing columns of
the working table in addition to defining a new one for the destination
account id.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src:Account)-[transfer:Transfers]->(dst:Account)
    WITH *, dst.id
    RETURN dst.id AS destination_id

    /*---+
     | destination_id |
     +---+
     | 7              |
     | 16             |
     | 16             |
     | 16             |
     | 20             |
     +---*/

In the following example, aggregation is performed implicitly because the
`WITH` statement has an aggregate expression but doesn't specify a `GROUP BY`
clause. All groupable items from the return item list are used as grouping keys
(This is equivalent to `GROUP BY ALL`).
In this case, the grouping keys inferred are `src.id` and `dst.id`.
Therefore, this query returns the number of transfers for each
distinct combination of `src.id` and `dst.id`.

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src:Account)-[transfer:Transfers]->(dst:Account)
    WITH COUNT(*) AS transfer_total, src.id AS source_id, dst.id AS destination_id
    RETURN transfer_total, destination_id, source_id

    /*---+
     | transfer_total | destination_id | source_id |
     +---+
     | 2              | 16             | 7         |
     | 1              | 20             | 16        |
     | 1              | 7              | 20        |
     | 1              | 16             | 20        |
     +---*/

In the following example, an error is produced because the `WITH` statement only
contains `dst`. `src` isn't visible after the `WITH` statement in the `RETURN`
statement.

    -- Error: src doesn't exist
    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (src:Account)-[transfer:Transfers]->(dst:Account)
    WITH dst
    RETURN src.id AS source_id

## Set operation

```
linear_query_statement

[
  set_operator
  linear_graph_query
][...]

set_operator:
  { 
    UNION ALL
    | UNION DISTINCT
    | INTERSECT DISTINCT
    | EXCEPT DISTINCT
  }

```

#### Description

Combines a sequence of linear query statements with a set operation.
Only one type of set operation is allowed per set operation.

#### Definitions

- `linear_query_statement`: A [linear query statement](#gql_syntax) to include in the set operation.

#### Details

Each linear query statement in the same set operation shares the same working table.

Most of the rules for GQL set operators are the same as those for
SQL [set operators](../standard-sql/query-syntax.md#set_operators), but there are some differences:

- A GQL set operator doesn't support the `CORRESPONDING` keyword. Since each set operation input (a linear query statement) only produces columns with names, the default behavior of GQL set operations requires all inputs to have the same set of column names and all paired columns to share the same [supertype](../standard-sql/conversion_rules.md#supertypes).
- GQL doesn't allow chaining different kinds of set operations in the same set operation.
- GQL doesn't allow using parentheses to separate different set operations.
- The results produced by the linear query statements are combined in a left associative order.
- Only the `UNION ALL` set operator supports input columns with type `GRAPH_ELEMENT`.

#### Examples

A set operation between two linear query statements with the same set of
output column names and types but with different column orders is supported.
For example:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, 1 AS group_id
    UNION ALL
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN 2 AS group_id, p.name

    /*---+---+
     | name | group_id |
     +---+---+
     | Alex |    1     |
     | Dana |    1     |
     | Lee  |    1     |
     | Alex |    2     |
     | Dana |    2     |
     | Lee  |    2     |
     +---+---*/

In a set operation, chaining the same kind of set operation is supported, but
chaining different kinds of set operations isn't.
For example:

    GRAPH graph_db.FinGraph
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, 1 AS group_id
    UNION ALL
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN 2 AS group_id, p.name
    UNION ALL
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN 3 AS group_id, p.name

    /*---+---+
     | name | group_id |
     +---+---+
     | Alex |    1     |
     | Dana |    1     |
     | Lee  |    1     |
     | Alex |    2     |
     | Dana |    2     |
     | Lee  |    2     |
     | Alex |    3     |
     | Dana |    3     |
     | Lee  |    3     |
     +---+---*/
