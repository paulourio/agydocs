## NAME

    [`gcloud topic gcloudignore`](topic-gcloudignore.md) - reference for .gcloudignore files

## DESCRIPTION

### Several commands in gcloud involve uploading the contents of a directory to

    Google Cloud to host or build. In many cases, you will not want to upload
    certain files (i.e., "ignore" them).

    If there is a file called .gcloudignore within the top-level directory
    being uploaded, the files that it specifies (see "SYNTAX") will be ignored.

    Gcloud commands may generate a .gcloudignore file; see the individual
    command help page for details.

    The following gcloud commands respect the .gcloudignore file:

      o gcloud app deploy
        * Note: If you add app.yaml to the .gcloudignore file, this command
          will fail.
      o gcloud functions deploy
      o gcloud builds submit
      o gcloud composer environments storage {dags, data, plugins} import
      o gcloud container builds submit
      o gcloud run deploy
      o gcloud run jobs deploy
      o gcloud alpha deploy releases create
      o gcloud infra-manager deployments apply
      o gcloud infra-manager previews create
      o gcloud alpha functions local deploy
      o gcloud alpha run jobs deploy
      o gcloud beta run jobs deploy
      o gcloud alpha run worker-pools deploy
      o gcloud beta run worker-pools deploy

    To globally disable .gcloudignore parsing (including default file-ignore
    behavior), run:

        $ gcloud config set gcloudignore/enabled false

    The default content of the generated .gcloudignore file, which can be
    overridden with --ignore-file, is as follows:

        .gcloudignore
        .git
        .gitignore

## EXAMPLES

    This .gcloudignore would prevent the upload of the node_modules/ directory
    and any files ending in ~:

        /node_modules/
        *~

    This .gcloudignore (similar to the one generated when Git files are
    present) would prevent the upload of the .gcloudignore file, the .git
    directory, and any files in ignored in the .gitignore file:

        .gcloudignore
        # If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or
        # files from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line below:
        .git
        .gitignore
        #!include:.gitignore

## SYNTAX

    The syntax of .gcloudignore borrows heavily from that of .gitignore; see
    https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore or man gitignore for a full reference.

    Each line in a .gcloudignore is one of the following:

      o pattern: a pattern specifies file names to ignore (or explicitly
        include) in the upload. If multiple patterns match the file name, the
        last matching pattern takes precedence.
      o comment: comments begin with # and are ignored (see "ADVANCED TOPICS"
        for an exception). If you want to include a # at the beginning of a
        pattern, you must escape it: \#.
      o blank line: A blank line is ignored and useful for readability.

    Some example patterns follow; see the full reference
    (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore or man gitignore) for details.

    To ignore any file named foo, and any file in the root of the upload
    directory named bar:

        foo
        /bar

    To ignore any file starting with foo, ending with bar, or starting with baz
    and ending with qux:

        foo*
        *bar
        baz*qux

    To explicitly include any file named foo (useful if foo was excluded
    earlier in the file) and ignore a file named !bar:

        !foo
        \!bar

    To ignore any directory foo and all its contents (though not a file foo),
    any file baz, and the directory qux and all its contents:

        foo/
        **/baz
        qux/**

### ADVANCED TOPICS

    In order to ignore files specified in the gitignore file, there is a
    special comment syntax:

        #!include:.gitignore

    This will insert the content of a .gitignore-style file named .gitignore at
    the point of the include line. It does not recurse (that is, the included
    file cannot #!include another file) and cannot be anywhere but the
    top-level directory to be uploaded.

    To display files that will be uploaded run:

        gcloud meta list-files-for-upload
